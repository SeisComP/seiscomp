Historical information
**********************

The first version of SeisComP was developed for the
:term:`GEOFON` program operated by :term:`GFZ`.

Originally, SeisComP was designed as a high-standard, fully automatic data acquisition and (near-)real-time
data processing tool including quality control, event detection and location as well as dissemination
of event alerts.

SeisComP was further extended within the MEREDIAN project under the lead of GEOFON and `ORFEUS`_.

Following the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the `GITEWS`_ (German Indian Ocean
Tsunami Early Warning System) project led to additional functionality being implemented to fulfill the
requirements of 24/7 early warning control centers. Major changes in the architecture of SeisComP
were necessary and many new features resulted in the upgrade of SeisComP to version 3.

Since 2008 SeisComP has been jointly developed by :term:`gempa GmbH`, a spin-off company of GFZ and GFZ.
Nowadays, gempa GmbH is the main SeisComP developing and service company.

Important SeisComP releases are shown below.
