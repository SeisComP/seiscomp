This chapter describes the concept of inventories.

Overview
========

In SeisComP the term :term:`inventory` refers to the meta data of data recording stations.
Many SeisComP applications require inventory information to operate correctly.
The inventory will be read from the :ref:`database <concepts_database>`
by default. To insert or update the inventory in the database, this information
needs to be created or downloaded and converted. The following sections will
describe the process of populating the database and how applications get access
to it. All SeisComP applications work the the internal inventory format also
known as SCML.

The inventory shall contain all meta data describing the full recording system and the
pre-processing of the raw data stream provided to the data processing modules
using the :ref:`RecordStream <concepts_recordstream>`. Inventories should be always complete w.r.t the
processed data streams, correct and up-to-date. Beside network, station, location
and stream information they must include the full sensor and datalogger responses.

Older version used key files to configure available networks and stations.
Because the support of response meta-data was very limited, tools were build to add
this functionality. Since the release of Seattle the concept of key files for station meta-data has
been completely removed from the system. Now SeisComP only handles station meta-data in its
own XML format called **inventory ML**.
The task of supporting old key files, dataless SEED and other formats has been
out-sourced to external applications. The inventory synchronization is a
:ref:`two-stage process <config-fig-inventory-sync>`:

#. Convert external formats into inventory ML
#. Synchronize inventory pool with the database: merged all inventory files and
   synchronize with the database using :program:`seiscomp update-config`.

   Inventory synchronization as a two-stage process

All station meta-data are stored in :file:`etc/inventory`
and can be organized as needed. Either one file per network, a file containing the complete inventory
or one file for all instruments and one file per station. The update script

.. code-block:: xml

   scinv sync

loads the existing inventory from the database and merges each file in :file:`etc/inventory`.
Finally it removes all unreferenced
objects and sends all updates to the database.

The SeisComP :ref:`configuration <concepts_modules>` does not deal with station meta-data anymore.
It only configures parameters for modules and module-station associations.
The management of the inventory can and should be handled by external tools, e.g. `SMP`_.

The SeisComP documentation describes the data model including the
:ref:`inventory <api-python-datamodel>`.

Inventory format
================

A typical inventory file in SCML looks like this:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <seiscomp xmlns="http://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/ns/seiscomp-schema/0.11" version="0.11">
     <Inventory>
       <sensor>...
       <datalogger>...
       <network>...
     </Inventory>
   </seiscomp>

The version attribute of the ``seiscomp`` tag represents the schema version of
the SeisComP data model which is consistent with the database schema version
and the version of all other representations.

Inventories must be provided to SeisComP in XML files in SCML format. A convenient
way to generate clean and correct inventory files in SCML format is `SMP`_.
Tools are provided to convert from other formats:

* :ref:`fdsnxml2inv`
* :ref:`dlsv2inv`
* :ref:`arclink2inv`

Adding/updating inventory
=========================

To add inventory information to the SeisComP database one either has to write directly
to the database with custom script (not recommended) or place SC ML files
under `etc/inventory`. The service to import all data in that directory can
be called with

.. code-block:: sh

   $ seiscomp update-config inventory

This command runs :ref:`scinv` finally. :ref:`scinv` merges all XML files and
synchronizes the merged local inventory tree with the database. That is a
rather complex process and for more information it is recommended to study
the source code of :ref:`scinv`. The bottom line is that inventory data is created
from SC ML files.

Because nobody will ever create such XML files by hand, tools are necessary.
A quite popular tools is the online station management portal `SMP`_.
This tool will output SeisComP XML directly.

Another source is the FDSN station webservice. If the SeisComP implementation
is being run then the SeisComP XML format can be requested directly as an
extension. Otherwise FDSN StationXML will be provided. That need to be converted
with either :ref:`fdsnxml2inv` or :ref:`import_inv`. The latter is a more versatile
application that also supports several import formats.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ import_inv fdsnxml download-1234.xml

This will automatically place the output SC ML file in :file:`etc/inventory`.
``seiscomp update-config inventory`` must be called afterwards to synchronize
the changes with the database. If ``scconfig`` is being used then either the
``Sync`` button of the `Inventory` panel or the ``Update configuration`` button of
the ``System`` panel must pressed.

**Summary**

In order to populate the database with inventory information, the following
steps have to be performed:

* Convert existing station meta data formats to SC ML
* Place all SC ML files at :file:`etc/inventory`
* Run ``seiscomp update-config`` or ``seiscomp update-config inventory``

Reading inventory
=================

Application usually connect to the database and read the necessary inventory
information. An application can decide whether it requires full response
information (sensor and datalogger response functions) or just channel
information (without instrument descriptions). The latter performs faster and
some applications do not full instrument information.

An application does not require special configuration to read
inventory information. A database connection is enough and it comes usually
along with the handshake message of the messaging server.

There are cases when an application should be run without a database connection
but requires inventory information, particularly in combination with the
``--ep`` command line argument. To direct an application to an inventory XML file
(again in SC ML format), ``--inventory-db`` must be used:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ myapp --inventory-db inv.xml

That will completely bypass the database (even if used for event information)
for reading inventory information. The file *inv.xml* can be created from the database
using :ref:`scxmldump`.
