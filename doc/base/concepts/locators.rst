Locators
########

Locators receive :term:`phase picks <pick>` from modules such as :ref:`scautoloc`,
:ref:`screloc` or :ref:`scolv` for locating seismic or non-seismic sources. The
solutions may include source time and location with or without uncertainties.
They are used to form new :term:`origins <origin>` which can be treated
further.

|scname| ships with built-in locators:

* :ref:`FixedHypocenter <global_fixedhypocenter>`
* :ref:`Hypo71 <global_hypo71>`
* :ref:`iLoc <global_iloc>`
* :ref:`LOCSAT <global_locsat>`, the default locator in :ref:`scautoloc` and :ref:`scolv`
* :ref:`NonLinLoc <global_nonlinloc>`
* :ref:`StdLoc <global_stdloc>`

and a none built-in locator:

* :ref:`LocExt <global_locext>`.

While the built-in locators are well defined and documented, any other external
locator routine can be added to |scname| by configuration of the locator
:ref:`LocExt <global_locext>` and custom scripts.
LOCSAT and FixedHypocenter are native to |scname|. All other locators are
implemented as :term:`plugins <plugin>`. A :term:`plugin`
needs to be added to the list of loaded plugins by configuration of the global
parameter :confval:`plugins` for making the corresponding locator available to
|scname| applications.

A comparison of the locators is given in the table below.

.. note::

   The specifications given below may depend on the configuration of the
   respective locator. Please carefully read the documentation of the locators
   for optimizing their performance.
