Overview
********

This overview section is intended to quickly introduce the reader into
key aspect of SeisComP and to provide the access points for further reading.

Modular structure
=================

A SeisComP system is not a single piece of software but it involves automatic and
interactive modules working
separately to process data and to analyze seismicity.
Read the :ref:`concepts section on modules <concepts_modules>` for more conceptional details.

Each module has a particular task, such as:

* Acquisition of waveform data from one or more providers
* Waveform archiving
* Waveform processing to identify phase arrivals
* Processing of phase picks to detect events and compute locations
* Providing a user interface for manually reviewing events

and many more. Key features are summarized in the :ref:`introduction <introduction>`.

   Real-time data acquisition, archiving and automatic processing combined with manual analysis.

Data acquisition modules
------------------------

Data acquisition modules allow to provide and store waveform data in real-time.
They are described in the acquisition section of the modules documentation.

Automatic processing modules
----------------------------

Automatic processing modules allow real-time or offline processing of waveforms and event parameters.
They are described in the processing section of the modules documentation.

Interactive modules
-------------------

Interactive :term:`GUI` modules show waveforms and processing results and allow user interactions:

* :ref:`scolv`: processing waveforms, locating events and determining magnitudes and focal mechnisms
* :ref:`scrttv`: view waveforms and phase picks, select events for processing in scolv, enable or disable stations
   for automatic processing
* :ref:`scmv`: view station locations on a map with status information and waveforms, select events for processing in scolv
* :ref:`scesv`: view the latest events on a map and relevant event parameters
* :ref:`scheli`: view the seismogram of a station in a helicorder plot, save images automatically
* :ref:`scqcv`: view waveform quality control (QC) parameters, enable or disable stations
   for automatic processing
* :ref:`scmm`: the messaging system monitor

The GUI modules are described in the Interactive analysis section of this documentation.

Inventory modules
-----------------

Inventory modules allow to manipulate inventories, e.g. to convert different formats
or to write information to the database.
They are described in the inventory section of the modules documentation.

Utility modules
---------------

Utility modules provide access to waveforms, the data base and much more.
They are described in the utilities section of the modules documentation.

Communication and database access
=================================

As modules run, they produce objects corresponding to geophysical concepts
such as :term:`picks <pick> and :term:`origins <origin>`.
These objects are exchanged with, and stored for later use by, other modules.
Communication between these modules happens in two ways:

#. Via objects stored in, and retrieved from, a shared database.
#. Via messages exchanged between modules.

Managing the communication between the modules in SeisComP is the job of the :ref:`messaging
system <concepts_messaging>`.
The messaging system is controlled by :ref:`scmaster`. It acts as gatekeeper to the database,
and only the module :ref:`scmaster` is allowed
write access to the database.
Additional details are found under :ref:`concepts_messaging` in the :ref:`concepts` chapter.

Waveform data
=============

Internally in SeisComP, most waveform data is currently handled as :term:`miniSEED` data (Data Only
:term:`SEED` records).
A time series of records is identified by its stream identifier,
following the SEED naming convention, ::

  NET.STA.LOC.CHA

where::

  NET - two or three letter alphanumeric network code
  STA - 1-5 letter alphanumeric station code
  LOC - 0 or 2-letter alphanumeric location code
  CHA - 3-letter channel or stream code

Here *alphanumeric* means the digits 0 to 9, and uppercase letters A-Z.

For publicly-available seismic stations these are typically supplied
by external servers such as :ref:`seedlink` or `CAPS`_ servers.
For example, the `GEOFON`_ seismic network makes data available at port 18000
at geofon.gfz-potsdam.de.

If you operate your own seismic network, you may collect data directly
from your station's digitizer using one of the many plugins included with
the :ref:`seedlink` module.
You can configure SeisComP to obtain data for each station via :term:`bindings`.
This configuration is described in the :ref:`tutorial on seedlink <tutorials_geofon_waveforms>`.

Waveform data can be saved locally, using SeisComP's :ref:`slarchive` module.
The waveform archive is organized in a structured way on your local file system,
with one file for each channel and day, known as the :term:`SDS` archive.
Thanks to SeisComP's :ref:`concepts_recordstream` concept, its modules
can be reconfigured to use the local data from an archive, a server or from files, allowing *playbacks*.
This ability to replay old waveforms and re-analyze them, is very
important for exploring your system configuration, and developing
SeisComP.

Finally, being both a collector and a server of waveform data,
:ref:`seedlink` allows you to chain SeisComP installations together to
obtain waveform data from upstream sources and relay it to other data users.

.. figure::  media/sc-acquisition-server.png
   :width: 10cm
   :align: center

   Data flow from data centers and stations via plugins to seedlink and the waveform archive
   both providing the data to local or remote SeisComP modules or other clients.

Access to waveform data
=======================

SeisComP modules can access waveform data from many difference sources,
such as a Seedlink server or an FDSN web service.

In SeisComP terminology, the data from these sources are *record streams*.
Access to the waveform data can be configured by setting an appropriate :term:`RecordStream`.
Read the :ref:`concept description of the RecordStream<concepts_recordstream>`
and :ref:`technical documentation of the various implementations <global_recordstream>` for many more details.

.. figure::  media/recordstream.png
   :width: 10cm
   :align: center

   The RecordStream interface provides flexible access to waveform data.

Taken together, this design gives SeisComP operators much flexibility.
Since messages can be exchanged between different computers, and
waveform data can be obtained from many sources, the different modules
do not all have to be on a single computer.
Multiple operators can connect to a single SeisComP installation from their own computers.

Station metadata
================

By :term:`inventory` we mean all information about seismic streams and stations
that is needed for processing the raw data obtained from sensors.
They are therefore also referred to as *station metadata*.
Read the :ref:`concepts section on inventory <concepts_inventory>` for more details
on formats and configuration in SeisComP.

Inventories include

* Names and time periods of networks, stations, locations and streams (epochs)
* Sample rates
* Instrument responses (sensor and data logger)
* Station and sensor coordinates

and other essential information.
Today there are some common formats to store metadata:

* FDSN StationXML
* SeisComP inventory
* Dataless SEED - the old *de facto* standard
* ArcLink XML.

Dataless SEED can be imported to, and exported from, SeisComP if needed.

You can get inventory information from various public sources including `EIDA`_ or
`IRIS`_ and many more. `SMP`_ allows you to create and share meta data from your own
station network and to export an intentory in :term:`SCML` format.

Inventories for all considered recording stations need to be imported
into SeisComP, and loaded into its database, before data can be processed.
There are various tools to do this.
The tools are described in the inventory section of this documentation.

.. note ::

   In order to process data streams, the inventory must provide complete response information
   for all the streams AND must match the :term:`bindings <binding>` configuration.

Configuration
=============

The basics of configuring a SeisComP system are described in the :ref:`concepts section <concepts_configuration>`.
The :ref:`tutorials` of this documentation provide step-by-step recipes.
The modules documentation explains the modules functioning, their configuration and
command-line parameters and give additional examples and links to related topics.

What next?
==========

The following :ref:`installation` section of this manual will help you install SeisComP.
You will then need to obtain some inventory and a source of waveform data.
Configure bindings, enable the processing modules, and restart SeisComP.
If all has gone well, you should see some stations as colorful triangles in
:ref:`scmv`,
and their traces in
:ref:`scrttv`.

Eventually, your new SeisComP system will pick and create origins,
should a locatable :term:`seismic event <event>` take place while it
is running.

Where to go for more help
=========================

The :ref:`tutorial on help<tutorials_help>` provides comprehensive list of options
